# Statistics_BinomialPoissonDistribution
The goal of this MATLAB project was to simulate the PMF of call failure for a network of 6000 users, allowing 150 simultaneous calls. The probability of a call is 2%, and 100k trials were ran. The results of this project show that binomial distribution PMF and the Poisson distribution PMF, and offer visual plots.
